This file describes the constants that will be used for the eVTOL concept presented in the following paper:
https://sacd.larc.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/167/2022/02/NASA-TM-20210017971.pdf 

The mass properties for this vehicle have been estimated using the paper above as a guideline. 

The mass properties mainly use the following excel sheet to derive the numbers that are used:
